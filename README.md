<h1 align="center"># Expert Armor #</h1>
<p align="center">

A FABRIC Mod to slow down the armor progression game.
Required on both client & server.

 

Its far too easy to obtain Iron armor on day 1, and within 2-3 days full diamond. 
The mod adds a craft-able plate for each armor (Leather, Iron, Gold, Diamond) - Netherite is being considered, but its already a quite a bit of a grind to get full set.

This changes the requirement for a full set of armor to cost 96 rather than 24 of the respective material.

For example

1 diamond plate = 4 diamonds

X _ X
_ _ _
X _ X

The diamond plate takes place of the diamond in the vanilla recipe (see below)

All plates can be converted back by placing in either player crafting square or crafting table.

Recipe unlock achievements all amended to suit.

 
This is my 1st mod, so there's bound to be issues.
Tools may come in the future if there is a demand for them.

ps. Thanks to Grend for helping me get started because i'm a noob!
